Super Fart Bros. is an HTML5 browser game similar to Super Smash Bros. You control a gnome and your goal is to attack the other gnomes with your farts until they run out of health and lives.

You can choose from three character builds: 

- fast running speed with little health
- medium speed with medium health
- slow speed with maximum health. 

Each gnome has the standard "fart cloud" attack, as well as one of three "special" attacks of their choosing:

- a flamethrower
- mines
- a bouncing fart cloud (the normal clouds are destroyed when they make contact with any object)

The gnomes also have a special "fartpack" which allow them to fly through the air using the propulsion from their flatulence.

This game was built using JavaScript on layered HTML5 canvases. The menu was created with jQuery. The particle effects were made with the help of [`fireworks.js`](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/fireworks.js). The gnome characters were created, rigged, and animated in 3DS Max; the animation frames were converted to `.png` spritesheets. Up to four USB gamepads can be accessed via Chrome's built-in APIs for 4-way simultaneous multiplayer. Two players can play using keyboard controls. There is a rudimentary AI to allow single-player gnome action.
