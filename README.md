SFB is a game similar to Super Smash Bros. for Google's Chrome browser. You control a gnome and your goal is to attack the other gnomes until they run out of health and lives.

This game was built using JavaScript on layered HTML5 canvases. The menu was created with jQuery. The particle effects were made with the help of fireworks.js. The gnome animations were created in 3DS Max and converted to spritesheets. Up to four USB gamepads can be accessed via Chrome's built-in APIs for 4-way simultaneous multiplayer. Two players can playing using keyboard controls and there is a rudimentary AI to allow single-player gnome action.
